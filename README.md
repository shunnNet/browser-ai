# Browser AI
**Not stable. Still working on it...**

This is a tool library for developing AI web applications at browser side, especially tailored for business applications that require compliance with rules.

This library can assist you in:

- Integrating LLM functionality with business logic.
- Translating user natural language into UI actions or executing specific functions.
- Navigating and guiding users.

## Features
- **Simple**: No complicate setting or parameters.
- **Atomic**: Atomic-level natural language functions. (`.is()`, `.whichIs()`, etc.)
- **Framework integration**: (Vue only currently):
  - Easily annotate node, routing information and incorporate prompts
  - Render component in LLM message
- **Typed**: Support Typescript.
